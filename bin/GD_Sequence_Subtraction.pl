=head1 NAME

  GD_Sequence_Subtraction.pl

=head1 VERSION

  Version 5.52

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  Given at least one nucleotide sequence and at least one short nucleotide
  sequence, the Sequence_Subtraction script seeks to remove the short sequence
  without changing the first frame translation of the large nucleotide sequence.
  The short sequence can be a restriction enzyme recognition site, in which case
  both the sequence and its reverse complement will be removed.

  If an organism or RSCU file is provided, the script will take RSCU values into
  account when making changes.

  Output will be named according to the name of the input file, and will be
  tagged with the _SS suffix.

=head1 USAGE

  -e OR -s must be provided. If both are given both will be processed.
      
=head1 ARGUMENTS

Required arguments:

  -in,  --input : a file containing nucleotide sequences.
  -e,   --enzymes : a comma separated list of restriction enzymes that can be
    found in the enzyme file specified in the config directory. All restriction
    enzymes in the list will have their recognition sites removed from the input
    sequences.
  OR
  -rem,  --removes : a file containing short nucleotide sequences, or paths to
    several separated by commas. Any instances of the short sequences will be
    removed from the input sequences.

Optional arguments:

  -org,   --organism : an organism whose RSCU table can be found in the config
    directory, or several separated by commas. flat is an option.
  -rscu,  --rscu : path to an RSCU table generated by GD_Generate_RSCU_Table.pl,
    or several separated by commas.
  -rev, --revcom : Whether or not to remove the sequence in both orientations.
    Assumed 1 for enzymes and 0 for other sequences.
  -out, --output : path to an output directory
  -f,   --format : output format of sequences
  -s,   --split : output all sequences as separate files
  -h,   --help : Display this message
