=head1 NAME

  GD_Juggle_Codons.pl

=head1 VERSION

  Version 5.52

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  Given at least one protein-coding gene as input, the Juggle_Codons script can
  use several algorithms to modify the sequence without altering its
  translation. It is thus possible to generate a sequence that is optimized for
  expression, as different as possible from the original sequence, or some
  combination of the two.

  If no algorithm is specified, the balanced algorithm will be used. These are
  the algorithms provided by default with GeneDesign; you can make your own; see
  developer docs.

  Output will be named according to the name of the input file, and will be
  tagged with _CJ.

  Algorithms:
    high: The high algorithm replaces every codon in the input sequence with
        the most translationally optimal codon as specified by the input RSCU
        tables or known RSCU tables (if organism is specified). If the codon is
        already the ideal codon it is left alone.
    balanced: The balanced algorithm uses the rscu data to determine a
         likelihood of codon replacement.
    most_different_sequence: The most different sequence algorithm attempts to
        change as many bases as possible within the codon, preferring
        transversions over transitions.
    least_different_RSCU: The least different RSCU algorithm attempts to replace
        as many codons as possible while minimizing disruption of the original
        average RSCU value for the sequence. It will not make a replacement if
        the absolute change in RSCU value is greater than 1.
    random: The random algorithm makes random replacements.

=head1 USAGE

  -r OR -org must be provided. If both are given the table will be treated as
      another organism, named after the table's filename.
      
  Generate high and most different sequences given the yeast rscu table
    ./GD_Juggle_Codons.pl -i sequences.FASTA -org yeast\
                                                 -a most_different_sequence,high
    
  Use my rscu table to generate balanced sequences
    ./GD_Juggle_Codons.pl -i seqs.FASTA -r /my/dir/myrscu.rscu -a balanced

=head1 ARGUMENTS

Required arguments:

  -i,   --input : a file containing nucleotide sequences.
  -org, --organism : an organism whose RSCU table can be found in the config
      directory, or several separated by commas
    AND/OR
  -r,   --rscu : path to an RSCU table generated by GD_Generate_RSCU_Table.pl

Optional arguments:

  -a,   --algorithm : which algorithms to use (see above), comma separated
          defaults to balanced
  -out, --output : path to an output directory
  -f,   --format : default genbank
  -s,   --split : output all sequences as separate files
  -h,   --help : Display this message
