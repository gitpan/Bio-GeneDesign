=head1 Functions

=head2 new

Create a new suffix tree object.

    my $tree = Bio::GeneDesign::PrefixTree->new();

=cut

sub new
{
  my ($class) = @_;
  my $self = { root => {} };
  bless $self, $class;
  return $self;
}

=head2 add_prefix

Add suffixes to the tree. You can add a sequence, an id (which can be an array
reference of ids), and a scalar note.
  
    $tree->add_prefix('GGATCC', 'BamHI', "i hope this didn't pop up");
    $tree->add_prefix('GGCCC', ['OhnoI', 'WoopsII'], "I hope these pop up");

=cut

sub add_prefix
{
  my ($self, $sequence, $id, $note) = @_;
  my @ids = ref($id) eq "ARRAY" ? @$id  : ($id);
  my $next = $self->{ root };
  my $offset = 0;
  my $len = length($sequence);
  while ($offset < $len)
  {
    my $char = substr($sequence, $offset, 1);
    $next->{$char} = {} unless exists $next->{$char};
    $next = $next->{$char};
    $offset++;
  }
  $next->{ids} = {} unless exists $next->{ids};
  foreach my $id (@ids)
  {
    $next->{ids}->{$id} = [] unless (exists $next->{ids}->{$id});
    push @{$next->{ids}->{$id}}, $note if ($note);
  }
  $next->{sequence} = $sequence unless exists $next->{sequence};
  $next->{count} = $next->{count} ? $next->{count} + 1  : 1;
  return;
}

=head2 find_prefixes()

Pass a sequence to the tree and find the positions of hits. It will return an
array that is made up of array references; each array reference represents a hit
where the 0 index is the name of the subsequence in the tree, the 1 index is the
offset in the query sequence (1 BASED, NOT 0 BASED), the 2 index is the
subsequence, and the 3 index is whatever note is associated with the
subsequence.

  my @hits = $tree->find_prefixes('AAAGGATCCATCGCATACGAGGCCCCACCG');
  
  # @hits = (['BamHI', 4, 'GGATCC', 'i hope this didn't pop up'],
  #          ['OhnoI', 21, 'GGCCC', 'I hope these pop up'],
  #          ['WoopsII', 21, 'GGCCC', 'I hope these pop up']
  #);

=cut

sub find_prefixes
{
  my ($self, $sequence) = @_;
  my @locations;
  my @seq = split('', $sequence);
  my $limit = scalar @seq;
  for my $seq_idx (0..$limit)
  {
    my $cur_idx = $seq_idx;
    my $ref_idx = $seq[$seq_idx];
    my $ref     = $self->{root};
    while (++$cur_idx < $limit and $ref)
    {
      if ($ref->{ids})
      {
        foreach my $id (keys %{$ref->{ids}})
        {
          my $notes = $ref->{ids}->{$id};
          push @locations, [$id, $seq_idx + 1, $ref->{sequence}, $notes];
        }
      }
      $ref_idx = $seq[$cur_idx];
      $ref = $ref->{$ref_idx};
    }
  }
  return @locations;
}


=head2 find_ntons

Pass a number, n. The tree will report all of the sequences inside it that it
has only seen n times. The return value is a hash, where the keys are the
sequences and the values are hash references containing the ids and notes
associated with each sequence in the tree.

  my %twos = $tree->find_ntons(2);
  
  # %twos = ('GGGCC' => {'OhnoI' => ['I hope these pop up'],
  #                    'WoopsII' => ['I hope these pop up']}
  # );


=cut

sub find_ntons
{
  my ($self, $n) = @_;
  $n = $n || 1;
  my %ntons;
  my $root = $self->{ root };
  my @nodes = map { $root->{$_} }keys %{$root};
  foreach my $node (@nodes)
  {
    if (exists $node->{sequence} && $node->{count} == $n)
    {
      $ntons{$node->{sequence}} = $node->{ids};
    }
    push @nodes, map { $node->{$_} }
                 grep {$_ ne 'sequence' && $_ ne 'ids' && $_ ne 'count'}
                 keys %{$node};
  }
  return %ntons;
}
1;
